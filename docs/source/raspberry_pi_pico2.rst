With a higher core clock speed, double the memory, more powerful Arm cores, optional RISC‑V cores, new security features, and upgraded interfacing capabilities, Raspberry Pi Pico 2 delivers a significant performance boost, while retaining compatibility with earlier members of the Raspberry Pi Pico series.

Programmable in C / C++ and Python, and with detailed documentation, Raspberry Pi Pico 2 is the ideal microcontroller board for enthusiasts and professional developers alike.

**Power Pins**

The Pico 2 pinout has been designed to directly bring out as much of the RP2350 GPIO and internal circuitry function as
possible, while also providing a suitable number of ground pins to reduce EMI (Electro Magnetic Interference) and
signal crosstalk. This is important in general but especially for RP2350 which is built on a modern 40nm silicon process
and hence the digital IO edge rates are very fast.

**General purpose I/O**

The Raspberry Pi Pico 2’s GPIO is powered from the on-board 3.3V rail and is therefore fixed at 3.3V.
The Pico 2 exposes 26 of the 30 possible RP2350 GPIO pins by routing them straight out to Pico 2 header pins. GPIO0
to GPIO22 are digital only and GPIO 26-28 are able to be used either as digital GPIO or as ADC inputs (software
selectable).
One thing to note is that the ADC capable GPIO26-29 have an internal reverse diode to the VDDIO (3V3) rail and so the
input voltage must not exceed VDDIO plus about 300mV. Also, if the RP2350 is unpowered, applying a voltage to these
GPIO pins will 'leak' through the diode into the VDDIO rail. Normal digital GPIO pins 0-25 (and also the debug p


Apart from GPIO and ground pins, there are 7 other pins on the main 40-pin interface:

  * **RUN**: The RP2350 enable pin, and has an internal (on-chip) pull-up resistor to 3.3V of about ~50kΩ. To reset RP2350, short this pin low.
  * **ADC_VREF**: The ADC power supply (and reference) voltage, and is generated on Pico 2 by filtering the 3.3V supply. This pin can be used with an external reference if better ADC performance is required.
  * **AGND**: The ground reference for GPIO26-29, there is a separate analog ground plane running under these signals and terminating at this pin. If the ADC is not used or ADC performance is not critical, this pin can be connected to digital ground.
  * **3V3(O)**: The main 3.3V supply to RP2350 and its I/O, generated by the on-board SMPS. This pin can be used to power external circuitry (maximum output current will depend on RP2350 load and VSYS voltage, it is recommended to keep the load on this pin less than 300mA).
  * **3v3(E)**: Connects to the on-board SMPS enable pin, and is pulled high (to VSYS) via a 100kΩ resistor. To disable the 3.3V (which also de-powers the RP2350), short this pin low.
  * **VSYS**: The main system input voltage, which can vary in the allowed range 1.8V to 5.5V, and is used by the on-board SMPS to generate the 3.3V for the RP2350 and its GPIO.
  * **VBUS**: The micro-USB input voltage, connected to micro-USB port pin 1. This is nominally 5V (or 0V if the USB is not connected or not powered).

A few RP2350 GPIO pins are used for internal board functions, these are:

  * **GPIO29** IP Used in ADC mode (ADC3) to measure VSYS/3
  * **GPIO25** OP Connected to user LED
  * **GPIO24** IP VBUS sense - high if VBUS is present, else low
  * **GPIO23** OP Controls the on-board SMPS Power Save pin
